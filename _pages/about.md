Hello! My name is Aadit Kolar. I'm in my 4th year in the 5 year BS/MS program in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am a member of the LEADS lab advised by Prof. Matthew Clarke.

My interests include Sustainable Aviation, GPU-based CFD methods, Aeroelasticity, Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) applied to aircraft preliminary design and sizing problems, and high-speed airbreathing propulsion. My current research involves multi-fidelity optimization methods for aircraft preliminary design and maximizing throughput of GPU-based CFD methods. 

I am currently looking for internships in Fall 2026 :)
